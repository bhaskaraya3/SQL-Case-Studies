# Common Table Expressions (CTEs) and Subqueries

## Explanation
- A **CTE** (Common Table Expression) is like a temporary named result set defined within a query.
- It improves **readability and reusability** of queries.
- A **subquery** is an inline query inside another query, useful for quick calculations.

## Key Takeaways
- CTEs make complex queries easier to manage and reuse.
- Subqueries are best when logic is needed only once.
- Multiple CTEs can be joined for handling layered conditions.
